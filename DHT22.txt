 Example testing sketch for various DHT humiditytemperature sensors
 Written by ladyada, public domain


 REQUIRES the following Arduino libraries
 - DHT Sensor Library httpsgithub.comadafruitDHT-sensor-library
 - Adafruit Unified Sensor Lib httpsgithub.comadafruitAdafruit_Sensor


#include DHT.h


#define DHTPIN 5      Digital pin connected to the DHT sensor
 Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 note use pins 3, 4, 5, 12, 13 or 14 --
 Pin 15 can work but DHT must be disconnected during program upload.

#define DHTTYPE DHT22    DHT 22  (AM2302), AM2321

 as the current DHT reading algorithm adjusts itself to work on faster procs.
DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);


void setup() {
 Serial.begin(9600);
 Serial.println(F(DHTxx test!));


 dht.begin();
}



void loop() {
  Wait a few seconds between measurements.
 delay(2000);

  Reading temperature or humidity takes about 250 milliseconds!
  Sensor readings may also be up to 2 seconds 'old' (its a very slow sensor)
 float h = dht.readHumidity();
  Read temperature as Celsius (the default)
 float t = dht.readTemperature();
  Read temperature as Fahrenheit (isFahrenheit = true)
 float f = dht.readTemperature(true);


  Check if any reads failed and exit early (to try again).
 if (isnan(h)  isnan(t)  isnan(f)) {
   Serial.println(F(Failed to read from DHT sensor!));
   return;
 }

 Serial.print(F(Humidity ));
 Serial.print(h);
 Serial.print(F(%  Temperature ));
 Serial.print(t);
 Serial.println(F(Â°C ));

}
